//! Basic digital signal processing (DSP) operations
//!
//! Digital signal processing based on real or complex vectors in time or frequency domain.
//! Vectors are expected to typically have a size which is at least in the order
//! of magnitude of a couple of thousand elements. This crate tries to balance between a clear
//! API and performance in terms of processing speed.
//!
//! Take this example:
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate num_complex;
//! # extern crate basic_dsp_vector;
//! # use basic_dsp_vector::*;
//! # fn main() {
//! let mut vector1 = vec!(1.0, 2.0).to_real_time_vec();
//! let vector2 = vec!(10.0, 11.0).to_real_time_vec();
//! vector1.add(&vector2).expect("Ignoring error handling in examples");
//! # }
//!
//! ```
//! If `vector2` would be a complex or frequency vector then this won't compile. The type mismatch
//! indicates that a conversation is missing and that this might be a programming mistake. This lib uses
//! the Rust type system to catch such errors.
//!
//! DSP vectors are meant to integrate well with other types and so they can for example be converted from and to a Rust standard vector:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::f32;
//! # use basic_dsp_vector::*;
//! # use basic_dsp_vector::conv_types::*;
//! let mut dsp_vec = vec![0.0; 1000].to_real_time_vec();
//! let mut buffer = SingleBuffer::new();
//! dsp_vec.interpolatei(&mut buffer, &RaisedCosineFunction::new(0.35), 2).unwrap();
//! let vec: Vec<f64> = dsp_vec.into();
//! assert_eq!(vec.len(), 2000);
//! ```` 
//!
//! DSP algorithms are often executed in loops. If you work with large vectors you typically try to avoid
//! allocating buffers in every iteration. Preallocating buffers is a common practice to safe a little time
//! with every iteration later on, but also to avoid heap fragmentation. At the same time it's a tedious task
//! to calculate the right buffer sizes for all operations. As an attempt to provide a more convenient solution
//! buffer types exist which don't preallocate, but store temporary memory segments so that they can be reused in the
//! next iteration. Here is an example:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::f32;
//! # use basic_dsp_vector::*;
//! let vector = vec!(1.0, 0.0, -0.5, 0.8660254, -0.5, -0.8660254).to_complex_time_vec();
//! let mut buffer = SingleBuffer::new();
//! let _ = vector.fft(&mut buffer);
//! ```
//!
//! The vector types don't distinguish between the shapes 1xN or Nx1. This is a difference to other
//! conventions such as in MATLAB or GNU Octave.
//! The reason for this decision is that most operations are only defined if the shape of the
//! vector matches. So it appears to be more practical and clearer to implement the few operations
//! where the arguments can be of different shapes as seperate methods. The methods `mul` and `dot_product`
//! are one example for this.
//!
//! The trait definitions in this lib can look complex and might be overwhelming at the beginning.
//! There is a wide range of DSP vectors, e.g. a slice can be DSP vector, a boxed array can be a DSP vector,
//! a standard vector can be a DSP vector and so on. This lib tries to work with all of that and tries
//! to allow all those different DSP vector types to work together. The price for this flexibility is a more complex
//! trait definition. As a mental model, this is what the traits are specifiying:
//! Whenever you have a complex vector in time domain, it's binary operations will work with all other
//! complex vectors in time domain, but not with real valued vectors or frequency domain vectors.
//! And the type `GenDspVec` serves as wild card at compile time since it defers all checks to run time.
